# Minecraft 1.16 Release Candidate
## A Minecraft Java Release Candidate

Out with the old, and in with the new! Today, we're introducing a new naming convention (well, it's been a while) for Minecraft Java Edition. Previously, the last pre-release was, in fact, the release candidate, but we're now making that more clear by changing the name to be "release candidate". This means that if there are no major issues following this release, no further changes will be done before the full release.

Speaking of the full release: In case you've been living under a rock (it's Minecraft, so that's OK), [we're releasing the Nether Update on Tuesday, June 23](https://www.minecraft.net/article/the-nether-update-has-date-). That's next week!

# Fixed bugs in 1.16 Release Candidate 1
